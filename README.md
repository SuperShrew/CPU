HOW TO USE:

at the start of your code file use a ! and a number to define the time it takes in seconds to do part of a cycle (this is not necassary and is automatically set to 1)

also just so you know if you have used the ! at the start, the ram address you are storing your instruction in is line number - 2, if not it is line number - 1
and a blank line is automatically set to 0 in the ram
also NO WHITESPACES AT THE END, START OR IN THE MIDDLE OF LINES IT WILL NOT WORK as of now

commands

1<address_here> = store current accumulator value at address specified. e.g. 187 (stores value in accumulator at address 87)
be careful not to overwrite any code you have stored whilst using this and any other commands that set an address to a value

2<address_here>
